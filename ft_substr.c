	"ft_substr" finds a string starting from the param "start"
	and allocates the found string according to "len" + 1 for the 
	"\0".

	firstly the function checks is the given pointer "s" is "NULL" to stop
	the processes since there is no nedd to allocate a string from "NULL".

	there are 3 cases to locate a substring within a string :
		ft_strlen(s) <= start :
			in this case the the only thing to be allocated is '\0'
			as there is nothng else to e allocated because the len is out of
			the string

		len >= ft_strlen(s):
			this case is more related to memory wasting.
			let's suppose that you have string contained from 16 characters,
			len is 30 and start is 6 
			since you have to allocate only 10 characters why would you allocate
			30 characters and most of them would be unsused. that's why I've used
			"ft_strdup".

		otherwise
			either make loop that goes over the string and copies from the "src"
			to the "pointer" or use directly "ft_strlcpy"
